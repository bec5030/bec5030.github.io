The first post is about this website and some of the developer tools I use.

As a developer I'm a big fan of free and open source software. I use [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) everyday for my version control and code hosting, and highly recommend them. Recently github released the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) which offers a whole bunch of incredibly awesome free services to student developers that would usually not be free. All you need is a .edu email address and you're good to go. One of
the many offerings is a free domain name for a year through [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). I decided to take advantage of that and got the domain name bradleyconn.me (now [bradleyconn.space](http://bradleyconn.space)). Shortly after I discovered [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which allows free hosting for static webpages through your GitHub account. 

I didn't want to start creating a website from scratch so I looked around and found this awesome project called [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) which allowed me to get the website up and running in no time. It is well documented and very easy to follow. GitHub Pages forces you to use [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), a simple, blog-aware, static site generator, written in ruby. After
[diving into it more](http://jekyllrb.com/) I have come to like jekyll and the setup jekyll-now has started me off with. The source code for this website can be found [here](https://github.com/BradleyConn/BradleyConn.github.io).
