I built a Mostly Printed CNC (MPCNC) at my home to expand upon my building capabilites. The MPCNC would allow me to take on highly detailed woodworking and drawing.

The very first thing attempted after assemly of the MPCNC was drawn a crown with a marker. This is that crown!

The next drawing had to be something more intricate to test out the MPCNC's capabilites so I chose this picture of Iron Man.

After completing the build of the MPCNC, I needed somewhere to house it. This picture shows the table built specifically for the MPCNC with plenty of room to keep materials and tools I would need for future projects.

After testing the drawing capabilites and establishing a space for the MPCNC, it was time to move onto cutting. A drag knife attachment can be mounted to cut materials such as paper or foam board. Here is a Batman logo cut from paper using a drag knife.

A router was attached to test cutting and engraving wood and other rigid materials. Here is one of the first cuts made, the logo of Token, the startup company I worked at for many years, carved into a coaster.

Again, I had to increase the intricacy to see what this machine I built could do. I used the NY Islanders logo and cut out a coaster. This one was a bit challenging but gave me an opportuinity to learn more about fine tuning the MPCNC.

Above you can see a variety of coasters cut by the MPCNC including the Token and Islanders coasters.

One of my favorite projects was an Adirondack 46ers tracker. Here you can see the beginning stages of the CNC cutting out the profiles of each of the 46 Adirondack mountains over 4000 feet in elevation.

Further along in the cutting process, you can see the tracker taking shape.

This is the final product! After cutting out all the mountains, the wood was stained and painted. As each mountian is climbed, a matching mountain "puzzle peice" is put on the board to mark that mountain as completed.

{:refdef}
Since builidng the MPCNC, many gifts have been made for family and friends. After cutting, sanding, and staining, this sign, reading "Winston's Workshop," was proudly displayed by the handy-man recipient.

{:refdef}
This sign, reading "110 Eagle St." accompanied by a cutout of an eagle, was also created as a gift. This picture shows the sign right after being cut, before sanding and staining.

This monsterra cutout was designed to be wall decor. Here you can see the cutting and engraving process.

The MPCNC project has given me a lot of opportunities to creatively problem solve. To eliminate hand-vacuuming, next steps include 3D printing a vacuum attachment. Many more projects are to come!
